                <h1>Exploring Aesthetics in Web Development: An Analysis of CSS, HTML</h1>
                <p>by Fernando Cardozo</p>

                <div class="introduction">
                    <h2 class="introduction__first-title">Going down to earth</h2>

                    <p class="introduction first-paragraph">What do I have to understand by C.R.A.P? well it's not nonsense.
                        Every design project that we undertake surely thinks that it must have the same characteristic
                        “it must be unique”, that is, it must have the characteristics to conquer the target and general public. Make our design something
                        different from the rest that impacts the recipient, has information, identity and emotion
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="introduction__second-title">For that we apply CRAP!</h3>

                    <p class="introduction second-paragraph">Web development has undergone a significant transformation as aesthetics currently play a crucial role in the user experience and
                        effectiveness of an interface. To achieve a visually attractive and functional appearance. Using two languages HTML
                        (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), developers seek to provide solutions through the fundamental
                        principles of visual design, encapsulated in the acronym PARC (Proximity, Alignment, Repetition, Contrast). The languages already
                        mentioned are two elements that have proven to be fundamental when creating visual, functional and captivating experiences in the digital
                        age since they shape the aesthetics of web pages.

                <div class="development">

                    <div class="contrast">
                        <h2>Contrast: Highlighting Importance</h2>
                        <p class="contrast first-paragraph">It is directed to the stimuli through the highlighting of elements or areas of the design, generating notable differences between them.
                            It consists of choosing the main element of the graphic product around which the others will “orbit”, but only the first will stand out from the rest. This is achieved
                            through the use of different colors, fonts, shapes, among others, promoting the brand in comparison scenarios with competitors.
                        </p>

                        <p class="contrast second-paragraph">In web design it is manifested by the combination of HTML and CSS to highlight key elements, the first provides the base and the second adds
                            the visual layers using the techniques you already mentioned, thus guiding the user's attention.
                        </p>

                    <div class="repetition">
                        <h2>Repetition: Consistency for a Strong Identity</h2>

                        <p class="repetition first-paragraph">It is nothing more than identical shapes identical or similar shapes that appear more than once in the design.
                            It consists of using the same element repeatedly throughout the graphic product. It is vitally important to resort to the repetition of elements
                            when the graphic product is made up of several pages such as catalogs or magazines, providing the design with coherence and consistency using the same fonts,
                            colors and shapes in all the products intended with the objective of building the brand, pro Therefore we can define an element as a key element to define the
                            visual identity of the user's gaze intuitively.
                        </p>
                        <p class= "repetition second-paragraph">HTML establishes the repetitive structure through the consistent use of classes and tags, while CSS can define common styles
                            for similar elements, allowing you to standardize and customize the patterns created, reinforcing the brand.
                        </p>

                    <div class="alignment">
                        <h2>Alignment: The Power of Coherence</h2>
                        <p class="alignment first-paragraph">As its name indicates, this principle contributes to the order of the design, starting with the general guideline that nothing should
                            be placed arbitrarily, therefore all elements must have a visual connection with something else on the page, favoring coherence and order.
                        </p>
                        <p class= "alignment second-paragraph">In layout and design the html accentuates the bases of the alignment is achieved through attributes such as text-align and vertical-align,
                            adjusts the visual layout through specific properties to align elements, intuitively guiding the user through an aligned design, an appearance clean and professional.
                            If the opposite happens, the brand could lose credibility (although there may be communication strategies that seek this).
                        </p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="proximity">
                        <h2>Proximity: Harmony in Disposition</h2>

                        <p class="proximity first-paragraph">This may be the first thing to take into account when designing. This is a simple principle that lies in the grouping of the elements that make up our design.
                            In this way, the public (receiver of the message we want to transmit) can transmit the message in a simple and direct way, allowing the message to be understood quickly. Therefore,
                            we must avoid having too many independent elements on the same page, thus avoiding grouping elements together without reason or explanation.
                        </p>

                        <p class="proximity second-paragraph">In web development this principle finds its place in the synergy of HTML and CSS, the first structures the content through a hierarchy of tags, thus defining the
                            logical proximity of the elements, while the second allows adjusting the visual proximity through of margins and spacing therefore. The result improves readability and user
                            perception.
                        </p>

                    <div class="conclusion">
                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>In the world of web development, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and other languages serve as essential tools for shaping the aesthetics and functionality of digital interfaces. The effective application
                            of visual design principles, encapsulated in PARC, allows developers to create engaging and cohesive user experiences. Proximity, alignment, repetition and contrast are not only key
                            concepts in web design, but also fundamental to achieving effective communication and a memorable user experience.
